10. Generate hosts files:

    a) Create a template called /home/x69van/ansible/hosts.j2. Complete the template so that it can be used to generate a file with a line for each inventory host in the same format as /etc/hosts
    b) Create a playbook called /home/x69van/ansible/gen_hosts.yml that uses this template to generate the file /etc/myhosts on hosts in the dev host group.
    c) When completed, the file /etc/myhosts on hosts in the dev host group should have a line for each managed host:

	Result expected:

      127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
