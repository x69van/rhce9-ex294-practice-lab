11. Create a playbook called /home/x69van/ansible/hwreport.yml that produces an output file called /root/hwreport.txt on all of the managed nodes with the following information:

    a) Inventory hostname
    b) Total memory in MB
    c) BIOS version

    Each line of the output file contains a single key-value pair.
      
	Example:

	INVENTORY_HOSTNAME=node-hostname
      	TOTAL_MEMORY_IN_MB=1024
      	BIOS_VERSION=2.1.2
