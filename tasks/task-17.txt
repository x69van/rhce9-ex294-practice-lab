17. Create and use partitions:

Create /home/x69van/ansible/partition.yml, which will create partitions on all the managed nodes: 

    a) After vdb creating a 1200M primary partition, partition number 1, and format it into ext4 filesystem.
    b) On the prod group to permanently mount the partition to /srv directory.
    c) If there is not enough disk space, give prompt information "Could not create partition of that size" and create a 800M partition.
    d) If vdb does not exist, a prompt message will be given "this disk does not exist."
